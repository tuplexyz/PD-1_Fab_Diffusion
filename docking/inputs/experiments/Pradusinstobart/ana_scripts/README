Analysis scripts: (to be run sequentially)
=================

i-rmsd_to_xray.csh: 

   calculate interface RMSD (backbone of all residues within 5A of 
   partner protein in reference structure)

   usage: 
          i-rmsd_to_xray.csh pdbfile1 pdbfile2 ...
       or
          i-rmsd_to_xray.csh `cat file.nam`


l-rmsd-xray.csh: 

   calculate ligand RMSD (backbone of ligand after fit on receptor)

   usage: 
          l-rmsd_to_xray.csh pdbfile1 pdbfile2 ...
       or
          l-rmsd_to_xray.csh `cat file.nam`


ana_structures.csh:

   HADDOCK structure statistic analysis script, but uses interface RMSDs
   instead of RMSD from lowest energy structure if data present (i-RMSD.dat)


ana_cluster.csh:

   HADDOCK cluster statistic analysis script, but uses interface RMSDs
   instead of RMSD from lowest energy structure if data present (i-RMSD.dat)


fraction-native.csh

   Calculate the fraction of native contacts. Output in file.nam_fnat
   
   usage:
          fraction-native.csh pdbfile1 pdbfile2 ...
       or
          fraction-native.csh  `cat file.nam`


cluster-fnat.csh

   Calculate the per-cluster average fraction of native contacts

   usage:
          cluster-fnat.csh  [nbest]

	  nbest is optional and can be defined to calculated in addition the
	  average over the nbest structures of a cluster


run_all.csh:

   Run all the above scripts for the water, it1 and it0 structures.

   Usage:
          run_all.csh  run-directory
