module (Data;)
    {*
    Module reads in the cryoEM data, supposed to be the CryoEM map. Since CNS
    is mainly build for X-ray Crystallography and thus reciprocal space,
    working in real space is a bit cumbersome. Therefor we first determine the
    map size and such befor reading it in. The unit cell is determined first
    and the resolution cutoff.  After that the FFT parameters can be determined
    and space is generated for the reflections. 

    It follows with reading in the form factors for all the atoms. The arrays
    FOBS, FCALC, FPART and MAP are allocated. The CryoEM map is read and the
    target function is set, which is here the so called vector potential. The
    vector potential is the reciprocal space variant of the cross correlation
    between two maps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Data : Data object
        The Data object holds all the parameter for the CryoEM functionality

    Notes
    -----
    After the call of this module one is able to use the XREF energy flag at will.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> ! Use the XREF energy term
    >>> @RUN:protocols/em_read_data.cns(Data=&Data;)
    >>> flags include XREF end
